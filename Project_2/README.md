# Project 2
## Quizzie

### Main Role
#### Controllers, 3 front-end angular components, DevOps

Project 2 was a collaborative effort consisting of two other individuals coming together and
 working on a quiz system called "Quizzie". There are two major parts of the project: the Front-
 end and the back-end. The Front-end utilized Angular/Typescript while the back-end utilized the
 Spring Framework for most of the back-end

My role in the front-end was very limited and amounts to adding the Quiz Session where a User
 takes a quiz stored on the system, a User dashboard, and the component where Quiz makers
 entered the quiz session. 

The back-end, I was more involved in developing Controllers which connected to the Spring Services
 and repositories (which accessed our database). I also played a role in DevOps, hosting the back-end's
 GitHub repository and publishing the back-end on an AWS EC2 instance. I also managed to get the 
 front-end live on an AWS S3 bucket.
