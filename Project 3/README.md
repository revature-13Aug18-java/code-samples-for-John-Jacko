# Project 3
## RideForce

### Main Role:
#### Font-end

Project 3 was a batchwide project. I was in the front-end team, which utilized Angular/Typescript -
 similar to Project 2. Project three was a system that could be used to facilitate communication
 between Revature "Drivers" and those who would ride with them to and from work.

One of the first tasks I undertook was the addition of a Car Registration component, much of which
 came from the AccountInfo Component but was refactored into it's own component.

I was also one of the individuals focused on Angular testing and explored ways to set up tests such that
 components would be created and the tests that checked them would not fail.

I was also focused on documentation throughout the entire project (though most of the files I
 commented on are not included). Using Compodoc, I was able to see the Documentation coverage
 rise to 96% by Compodoc's standard.

I also took looks at the map component and working with the matching service team to debug problems
 on their end (though I never committed any code to their repository).
