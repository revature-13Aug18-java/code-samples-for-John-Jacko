# Revature Project Overview (Java EE, August 2018, Reston VA)

The Repository is meant to showcase project files I specifically worked on. During the course of 
Revature training, we were assigned four major projects.

# Project 0: ("Project_0")

Project 0 was a Banking app that was meant to host User accounts from which a User can log
 on and "deposit" money as well as "withdraw" money. The Technologies used were Core Java 
 and SQL, with JDBC allowing the back-end to communicate with an Oracle database

# Project 1: (In folder "Project1")

Project one was similar to project 0, only it was an Employee reinbursement system. There are
 2 types of Users: Employee and Manager. Employees can make reimbursement requests as 
 well as view their own. Managers can view/filter requests as well as Approve or reject requests.
 The technologies used were HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, AJAX, and Java sevlets - in
 addition to the technologies used in Project 0

# Project 2: (In folder "Project_2")

Project 2 was a collaborative effort consisting of two other individuals coming together and
 working on a quiz system called "Quizzie". There are two major parts of the project: the Front-
 end and the back-end. The Front-end utilized Angular/Typescript while the back-end utilized the
 Spring Framework for most of the back-end

# Project 3: (In folder "Project 3")

Project 3 was a batchwide project. I was in the front-end team, which utilized Angular/Typescript -
 similar to Project 2. Project three was a system that could be used to facilitate communication
 between Revature "Drivers" and those who would ride with them to and from work.
