Project 0 was a Banking app that was meant to host User accounts from which a User can log
 on and "deposit" money as well as "withdraw" money. The Technologies used were Core Java 
 and SQL, with JDBC allowing the back-end to communicate with an Oracle database.

The "Front-end" was a Java Console command handler that called functions directly to the "back-
 end." The "back-end featured a static class "AccountManager" which used a map to keep track of 
 logged on users and used an integer token that the "front-end" used when calling account functions.

Note: this was only one application with one user at a time, which featured both the "front-end" and the 
 "back-end", hence why the two terms were in quotes throughout the read-Me.
